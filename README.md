# Kris's Hobby Garage

A single-page React application that showcases my car hobby:
BMW engines, M3s, Porsche 911 GT3 RS, and JDM legends like the RX-7 and R34
"Mona Lisa". The app demonstrates component-based UI with a Header, Carousel,
Accordion, Footer, and a Tailwind CSS-based card grid.

## Features

- **Header** – title + subtitle describing the app.
- **Hobby Cards** – Tailwind CSS card grid that lists my core interests.
- **Carousel** – browsable list of cars I'm learning about.
- **Accordion** – FAQ-style component about the hobby.
- **Footer** – basic site info and external links.
- **Responsive layout** – works on desktop and mobile.

Wireframes for desktop and mobile layouts are included in:
